One of my First Projects after joining the Stevens Baja team, During this project I designed and built a Brake pedal for An off road car. During this Project I developed concepts in Solidworks, before performing FEA to ensure the design could withstand the required forces. After this I performed Topology analysis to further reduce the weight of the pedal arms. This design went through many iterations to increase manufacturability, most parts were designed to be Plasma cut, with only 2 unique machined pieces required.
