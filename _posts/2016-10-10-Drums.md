In my free time I enjoy playing the drums, and have designed and built several drums in my free time
I designed the Pictured Electronic Snare drum to replace the OEM model on my Roland electronic drum set. It includes a Stave constructed outer shell, and the three pronged inner support which adds structural integrity to the drum and provides a mounting surface for the electronics. It has a custom made high density foam trigger cone and is designed to work with standard tension rods and drum heads.
