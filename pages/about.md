Hello, My name is Edward Pieluc and I am a aspiring Mechanical engineer with intrests in advanced manufacturing, fluid mechanics, and design. I have experience working in both traditional(machine shop) manufacturing enviroments as well as advanced R&D manufacturing. I also have years of design experience working on my university's Baja SAE team, where I designed parts in the Powertrain and chassis sub-systems. In my free time I enjoy designing and building all kinds of projects, photography and playing the drums.
